# Battleship Game

This project is a part of The Odin Project curriculum, where I implemented the classic Battleship game using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **Webpack**. The game allows users to play the Battleship game directly in the browser with a simple, clean interface.

## Features

- **Player vs. AI**: Play against an AI opponent with randomly placed ships.
- **Ship Placement**: Ships are placed on a grid and can be attacked by the opponent.
- **Game Flow**: The game alternates turns between the player and the AI.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern JavaScript**: This project uses ES6 features like classes, modules, and arrow functions.
- **Webpack Setup**: The project is bundled using Webpack for a streamlined development experience.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: The game logic, interactivity, and AI were all implemented using Vanilla JS (ES6+).
- **CSS**: The user interface is styled with modern CSS, utilizing Flexbox for layout and custom styles.
- **Webpack**: Used for module bundling, transpiling JS, and managing assets.epo template that includes webpack
